<h1>2023 NBA Draft</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project dives into the 2023 NBA Draft class, focusing on key stats such as points/game, assists/game, rebounds/game, steals/game. Though there are a lot of other major factors that go into picking a player, I was curious to see which picks from the draft were initially beneficial and harmful in their first season.
